# MCS8a
Comms and DAQ w/ FastComTec MCS8a TDC.

## Notes

Currently,
only some very rudimentary things are implemented.
Some data structurs are copied from Qudi 
from the MCS6 project.
At the moment,
the class can surely be used
to communicate with the MCS8a server
to read the ROIRate in counts per seconds.
This can be used to control the desorption laser.
